### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

APIs. First go at using one. I quickly came across the fetch() method and ran with it. 

### Continued development

Will continue to work on more complicated API data integration. Noticed that firefox might not fetch more than once and I'll need to figure that out.

### Useful resources

- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

### As always feedback is welcome! Thanks for checking this out.
